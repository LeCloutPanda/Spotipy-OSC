# Spotipy-OSC
This is a very simple Spotipy and OSC program that let's a osc controller play/pause, skip to next/previous songs and it provides the current song name and image when skipping songs or every 1 second if it changed.

This was made for use inside [Resonite](https://resonite.com) in tandem with the public item(resdb:///58a00b7497a93b8f29f7f4976e33961c792eda338ff3c4ec8a937dac230bf9d5.brson) I made in my public folder(resrec:///U-LeCloutPanda/R-35750C0A6989D846AAF0E0F3BEC6368F99A55BD04C60F3F171B2E809D34BEDC6) under ``Pandas Hell Folder > Tools > Spotipy-OSC``
